## CRITICAL: Skills Being Ignored

Skills are frequently ignored without enforcement. See `lessons/SKILL.md` → "Skills Being Ignored" incident for the fix.

**Key violations:**
- Creating new plans instead of updating MASTER_PLAN.md
- Dates in filenames instead of frontmatter
- Test scripts in project root
- Missing timestamps in updated fields
